minor addition caused a lot of problems with certain terminals and environments, 
and the benefits aren’t really worth it. 

- redrew the Braille characters (U+2800...) (again)

- redrew U+A690 U+A691

### Removed

#──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [println("uni", uppercase(string(c, base=16))) for c in 0x3358:0x3370];
    [println("uni", uppercase(string(c, base=16))) for c in 0xFE10:0xFE1F];
    [println("uni", uppercase(string(c, base=16))) for c in 0xFE30:0xFE4F];
    [println("uni", uppercase(string(c, base=16))) for c in 0xFF00:0xFFEF];

#──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## [v0.054] - 2024-03-05

### Added

- retro computing symbols: U+2427 ... U+2429, U+1CC00 ... U+1CEAF
    These will be introduced in Unicode v16 this year 
    [PDF here)](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21235r-terminals-supplement.pdf), 
    they might need modifying once more information appears...

- supplemental arrows U+1F8B2 ... U+1F8C1

- ss17 replaces Braille Characters with the equivalent Octants (U+1CD00 ... U+1CDE5). It's been suggested that
    octants might be better than Braille glyphs for more detailed graphics (eg see UnicodePlots), 
    but this ss doesn't confirm this.

### Changed

- Germandbls U+1E9E design improved

- box drawing characters tweaked

- arrows at U+21c4

### Removed

### Deprecated

#──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## [v0.053] - 2023-12-26

- numbers now accept non-spacing marks (such as a dot U+0307 or a hat U+0302) #196

- U+FFFC (fontbakery.com told me I should add it)

### Changed

- combining diacriticals U+0305, U+0332, U+0333, U+0336, U+033F now extend across the full width of the glyph, as per Unicode spec

### Removed

- soft hyphen (U+00AD) - fontbakery.com told me to remove it
 

### Deprecated

#──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## [v0.052] - 2023-11-30

-  (U+F35D) Private Use Area: external link icon: this popular icon never quite made it into Unicode (proposal [here](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18303-external-link.pdf)) but it's useful.

- added mirrored versions of the non-mirrorable glyphs for BiDi (ie right-to-left): ⅀, ∁, ∂, ∃, ∄, ∑, ∖, √, ∛, ∜, ∝, ∦, ∫, ∬, ∭, ∮, ∯, ∰, ∱, ∲, ∳, ∹, ∻, ∾, ∿, ≀, ≁, ≂, ≄, ≆, ≇, ≈, ≉, ≊, ≋, ≟, ≠, ≢, ⊌, ⊧, ⊪, ⊬, ⊭, ⊮, ⊯, ⊾, ⊿, ⋵, ⋸, ⋹, ⋿, ⌠, ⌡, ⟀, ⟌, ⟓, ⟔, ⦜, ⦝, ⦞, ⦟, ⦢, ⦦, ⦧, ⧂, ⧃, ⧉, ⧎, ⧜, ⧡, ⧣, ⧤, ⧥, ⧴, ⧶, ⧷, ⨊, ⨋, ⨌, ⨍, ⨎, ⨏, ⨐, ⨑, ⨒, ⨓, ⨔, ⨕, ⨖, ⨗, ⨘, ⨙, ⨚, ⨛, ⨜, ⨞, ⨟, ⨠, ⨡, ⨤, ⨦, ⨩, ⨾, ⩗, ⩘, ⩪, ⩫, ⩬, ⩭, ⩯, ⩰, ⩳, ⩴, ⪣, ⫝̸, ⫢, ⫦, ⫳, ⫻, ⫽, 𝛛, 𝜕, 𝝏, 𝞉, 𝟃 (issue #192)

- 点 (U+70B9) 

- some missing Latin-C glyphs: Ⱨ (U+2c67), Ⱪ (U+2c69), Ɱ (U+2c6e), Ⱳ (U+2c72), Ⱬ (U+2c6b), ⱸ (U+2c78), ⱶ (U+2c76), ⱨ (U+2c68), ⱪ (U+2c6a), ⱹ (U+2c79), ⱴ (U+2c74), ⱱ (U+2c71), ⱳ (U+2c73), ⱬ (U+2c6c)  

### Changed

- modified ᲁ, ᲅ (issue #193)

- modified precedence characters so that they look a bit different from ordinary operators ≺, ≻, ≼, ≽, ≾, ≿, ⋨, ⋩, ⪯, ⪰, ⪱, ⪲, ⪳, ⪴, ⪵, ⪶, ⪷, ⪸, ⪹, ⪺ (issue #190)

- modified ᵢ (U+1D62 subscript i) to distinbguish from ₁ (U+2081 subscript 1) on lower resolution displays: dσ_du₁, dσ_duᵢ (issue #184)

- italic l is slightly redesigned to look different from italic 1 (issue #152)

- hopefully fixed diacritics for DIN 91379 (issue #180)

- tweaked consistency of arrows. There appear to be three groups in Unicode:

    U+2B00: ⬀⬁⬂⬃⬄⬅⬆⬇⬈⬉⬊⬋⬌⬍

    U+2B95: ⮕

    U+2794: ➔➕➖➘➙➚➛➜➝➞➟➠➡➢➣➤➥➦➧➨➩➪➫➬➭➮➯➱➲➳➴➵➶➷➸➹➺➻➼➽➾⟵⟶⟷⟸⟹⟺⟻⟼⟽⟾⟿ 

### Removed

- U+FB31 -> U+FB35, U+FAB2 have been removed. These were glyphs that emulated NerdFonts' Private Use Area icons, but they shouldn't have been put there originally, since that's not a PUA, but Hebrew, so they've now been removed from NerdFonts and JuliaMono. 

### Deprecated

- more fiddling to get marks placed correctly. Some progress might be seen...

- the [source files](https://github.com/cormullion/juliamonomaster/) are available in `.glyphs` format instead `.glyphspackage` format. Even Github was complaining about the number of files being changed...

## [v0.046] - 2022-08-15

### Added

- small updates required for Unicode 15 - mostly transuranian symbols u1f774 ... (🝴🝵🝶🝻🝼🝽🝾🝿🟙) :) 

- added Variation Selector support for switching between Cursive and Roundhand

  eg `u1d4d0`, mathematical bold script capital a, returns Cursive A, "𝓐" , but when u1d4d0 is followed by 0xFE01 (VS2), it returns Roundhand A, "𝓐︁" 
  
  This works for Capital letters only. See [this Unicode PDF](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20275r-math-calligraphic.pdf) for the details.
  
- added some Arabic glyphs; should be considered place-holders at present

- raised colon alternate for seven segment displays:

```
using Dates
t = now()
h = hour(t) 
m = minute(t)
s = second(t) 
str = lpad(h, 2, "0") * lpad(m, 2, "0") * lpad(s, 2, "0")
for (n, c) in enumerate(str)
    print(Char(0x1fbf0 + parse(Int, c)))
    n ∈ (2, 4) && print(":")
end

🯱🯴:🯳🯵:🯱🯸
```

### Changed

### Removed

- ligature for '<' and '-'; otherwise it's not possible to write `z<-1`

### Deprecated

#──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## [v0.045] 2022-05-05

### Added

- Symbols for Legacy Computing: U+1FB00 to 1FBFF mostly characters from old 1980s computers such as Commodores and Sinclairs... (useful? 🤷)
